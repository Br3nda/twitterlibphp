twitterlibphp - Twitter/PHP interface

This is a simple interface to the Twitter API.

I've tried to keep as close as possible to the real API
calls (some had to be changed due to ambiguity), but all
of the arguments are as they are in the official docs.

For documentation, go to:
 
    http://jdp.github.com/twitterlibphp/doc
    http://apiwiki.twitter.com

Usage:

	$twitter = new Twitter("username", "password");
	$public_timeline = $twitter->getPublicTimeline();
